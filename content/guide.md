You'll need a logged in Discord account token for this to work properly.

## Steps

1. Login in into your account (or your grandma's own) from <https://discord.com/login>
2. Open the developer tools (`F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`)
3. Grab the token from the local storage (`Application > Local Storage > https://discord.com > "token"`) and copy the values between the quotation marks

_Don't worry you can always logout when you're done if you think I'm gonna steal your account._
